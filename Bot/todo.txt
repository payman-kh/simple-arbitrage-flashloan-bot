To-do list:
- dig into the events.ts
- check events sample snippet
- start working on eventSubscriber.ts






Things for later:
A couple of minor notes before we move on:
- setInterval is unbounded – if the processing inside the interval ever takes longer than intervalMs,
  calls could overlap. Later you might want a “self-adjusting” loop with setTimeout or while(true) +
  await sleep(intervalMs) to avoid overlapping requests.
- The interval is currently hard-coded for Polygon (3000ms) — you mentioned you’ll make it dynamic per
  chain, which is fine.
