To-do list:
- dig into the events.ts
- build the for loop in scanner.ts
- build the subscriber and bypass the dexes






Things for later:
A couple of minor notes before we move on:
- setInterval in scanner.ts is unbounded – if the processing inside the interval ever takes longer than intervalMs,
  calls could overlap. Later you might want a “self-adjusting” loop with setTimeout or while(true) +
  await sleep(intervalMs) to avoid overlapping requests.
- The interval is currently hard-coded for Polygon (3000ms) — you mentioned you’ll make it dynamic per
  chain, which is fine.

When responding to a lp event:
- Ultra-optimized (harder, later)
  Sometimes the event data itself gives you enough info to update state without even re-fetching:
  A Sync(reserve0, reserve1) event literally tells you the new reserves.
  From reserves you can compute price instantly (price = reserve1 / reserve0 adjusted for decimals).
  ✅ No RPC calls, super fast.
  ❌ But you need to maintain formulas per DEX type (V2, V3, Curve, Balancer all differ).

There is also a uniswapv4 which is really different:
